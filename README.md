# 🕹️ Vibing Arkanoid

A loving tribute to the legendary **Arkanoid** (Taito, 1986) — rebuilt from scratch as a modern browser game with retro Amiga aesthetics, epic boss battles, and a high-performance canvas engine.

## ✨ Features

- **20 levels** of increasing difficulty with hand-crafted brick layouts
- **4 boss battles** (levels 5, 10, 15) + a Mega Boss on level 20 with 3 phases, cross projectiles, music-reactive visuals, and danger ball mechanics
- **Boss Rush mode** — fight all bosses back-to-back
- **13 power-ups**: Fireball, Multi-Ball, Extend, Shield, Barrier, Slow Down, Turrets, Stunner, Reflect, Homing, Shrink, Extra Life, Second Chance
- **Q-U-M-R-A-N bonus letters** — collect all 6 for 5 extra lives
- **Two difficulty modes**: Normal (3 lives) and Godlike (1 life, faster speed)
- **Online leaderboards** with difficulty filters (All / Normal / God-Mode) and Boss Rush times
- **CRT overlay** and authentic retro pixel styling
- **Adaptive quality** — automatically adjusts visual effects for smooth performance
- **Mobile support** with touch controls and swipe gestures
- **Original chiptune soundtrack** with per-level music

## 🏗️ Architecture

The game runs a **decoupled engine** — all game objects (ball, paddle, bricks, bosses, enemies) update in a dedicated loop, separate from React's render cycle. The canvas draws directly from the engine world in its own `requestAnimationFrame` loop, bypassing React reconciliation entirely.

Key technical details:

- **Continuous Collision Detection (CCD)** with sub-stepping and TOI (Time of Impact) calculations
- **Spatial hashing** for efficient brick/entity collision lookups
- **Object pooling** for balls, power-ups, bullets, bombs, enemies, particles, and bonus letters
- **Cached gradients** and single `Date.now()` per frame to minimize allocations
- **Adaptive quality system** that scales visual effects (CRT overlay, glow, shadows) based on FPS
- **Production telemetry** for anonymous performance metrics
